Future work of this project will be to enhance its scope by adding on the concept of machine learning in the web portal and to make hardware module more portable and easy to use. Following are some improvements that can be made in future:
\begin{itemize}

\item \textbf{Use of ordinary board marker:} 
If the proposed system hardware is implemented using computer vision techniques then stereo vision cameras will be easily used to detect the position and orientation of even ordinary board marker.

\item \textbf{Increase in Board Dimension:}
With the use of high resolution cameras, the proposed system can be used to record the lecture i.e orientation and position extraction with large board dimensions.

\item \textbf{Noise removal in audio:}
With the implementation of different filtering techniques like adaptive filtering, Kalman filtering, sub-band filtering, gamma filtering and modified Wiener in the proposed project, the noise will be easily removed from the voice recorded.

\item \textbf{Automatic notes generation:}
With the implementation of machine learning algorithm in the online lecture, proposed project will be used for automatic notes generation of each lecture against each video provided on the web portal.

\item \textbf{Complete LMS:}
By adding more functionalities in the web portal e.g admission system, Fee submission etc. the proposed can e used as a complete LMS for any educational institution in replacement with the manual work. 

\item \textbf{Recording in uncontrolled environment:}
By making proposed system much more efficient i.e. training system on different conditions, the proposed system will be used to record the lecture in any environment mean under dim light of any colored light.

\item \textbf{Automatic Google searching:}
If the system is trained using machine learning algorithm then proposed system will be used for Google searching of tough terms of unique terms related to lectures automatically to provide the ease for the students to understand the lecture in a better way.

\end{itemize}
