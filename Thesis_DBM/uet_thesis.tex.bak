In a new educational concept, the Lecture Recording system is one of the devices that are widely used to provide educational material to students. Lecture recording plays an important role in online learning and distance education. Most of they are recorded by a cameraman or a static camera. But high resolution recorded video require lot of storage space and also the internet bandwidth. In this work, a storage and bandwidth efficient lecture recording system is proposed to minimize the storage and bandwidth issues. This system is 100 times more efficient that the previously developed lecture recording system. This system is also small in size and portable. This lecture recording system allows students to re-experience the lecture session at anytime and anywhere by downloading it with the minimum bandwidth available or viewing it through the portal. It is made public to promote research and further development in this system. The proposed system is combination of hardware module and software modules. Its first step is position detection at each point of board marker through stereo vision cameras to generate a file that will later be easily played offline as well as online on the web portal. \ldots
